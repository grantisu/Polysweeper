Polysweeper
===========

Polysweeper is a Minesweeper clone, heavily influenced by [Xbomb](
http://www.gedanken.org.uk/software/xbomb/ ). It is a single, self-contained
HTML page, which should work in any modern browser that properly supports SVG
and JS Web Storage (FF & Chrome).

Features:

- Five different polygon types
- Adjustable board size & bomb count
- High Score list
- One file: no compilation step; no server needed
- Works on most smartphones
